= Concurrent Matrix Multiplication with Tiling

This implementation of matrix multiplication reduce L1 cache miss by tiling matrix to benefit from memory locality.

This is an experiment to compare with an untiled C implementation compiled in LLVM.

The result is the C implementation takes only nanoseconds. On the other side, the JRE7 with vectorization flags takes milliseconds.
