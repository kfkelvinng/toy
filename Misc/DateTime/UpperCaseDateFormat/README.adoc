= Upper Case DateFormat

Imagine I have Spring bean factory that takes DateFormat and I want the dateformat to be 01-JAN, 02-FEB, 03-MAR in uppercasein uppercase, but the ordinary SimpleDateFormat would only format it to 01-Jan, 02-Feb, 03-Mar with "MM-MMM".

How could implement the DateFormat in such a way which format date into uppercase?
