This is basically `sum(range(N,3))+sum(range(N,5)-sum(range(N,15))`
O(1) way to compute that is arithmetic series

```
for i in range(int(raw_input())):
    target=(int(raw_input())-1)
    t3=target-(target%3)
    t5=target-(target%5)
    t15=target-(target%15)
    print (3+t3)*t3/3/2 + (5+t5)*t5/5/2 - (15+t15)*t15/15/2
    
```
